          The average national price of a demand letter when purchased directly
          through an attorney or law firm is roughly $1,375. Some attorneys
          charge between $3,000 and $5,000 in legal fees for an identical demand
          letter service. Total insanity! The logic is that most attorneys want
          to take your "case", not piece-meal a demand letter service - and
          therefore they normally require a "retainer" for which they can draw
          from just to write your one-off letter.

          How do we do it?

        <Text variant="primary" size="sm" className="capitalize text-start">
          It's simple. Letter writing is one of the most frequent tasks for all
          business and contract attorneys. We've partnered with great attorneys
          accross the United States that have agreed to participate in our
          $199/per letter model because it normally doesn't cost them more than
          three hours of time or their paralegal's - and they still make a small
          profit while working to earn your future business if it's required
          beyond the letter writing.

          In addition, and as an aside, our staff writers and optimizers review
          all letters prior to delivery to ensure they are optimized to the
          fullest extent based on data and insights we've collected from
          hundreds of letters, transactions, responses and reactions received
          from the recipients that have received a letter that was sent to them
          by an attorney via the LetterDash platform.
